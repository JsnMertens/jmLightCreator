# jmLightCreator
jmLightCreator is a free tool in python I have written for easily creating lights in Maya.
Feel free to use it in your own projects or in production. *(Optimized for MtoA)*

## Installation

1. Download and unzip the *jmLightCreator.zip* file from [github](https://github.com/JsnMertens/jmLightCreator/archive/master.zip)

2. Place this folder where you want on your computer or server but you need to specify to **MAYA_MODULE_PATH** environment variable where is located this folder to allow maya to find it.
So for example you extract  under **c:\jmLightCreator-master**.
To get it recognize by maya you need to add the following line in the **maya.env** file : **MAYA_MODULE_PATH = C:\jmLightCreator-master**
